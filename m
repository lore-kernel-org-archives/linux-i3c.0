This series adds support for the NXP P3H2x4x family of multi-port I3C
hub devices, including their on-die regulators and downstream I3C/SMBus
target ports

The series introduces:
- Core I3C master enhancements required for hub support
- Generic I3C hub framework
- MFD driver with regulator and I3C hub child drivers for the P3H2x4x I3C hub

The dependency order within the series is:

- Patches 1 and 2 provide the I3C core helpers required by the generic
  I3C hub framework
- Patch 3 provides the P3H2x4x Device Tree binding
- Patch 4 provides the MFD parent required by both the regulator and
  P3H2x4x I3C hub child drivers
- Patch 5 provides the regulator child driver and depends on patch 4
- Patch 6 provides the generic I3C hub framework and depends on the
  I3C core changes in patches 1 and 2
- Patch 7 provides the P3H2x4x I3C hub child driver and depends on
  patches 4 and 6
- Patch 8 extends the P3H2x4x hub driver with SMBus slave mode support
  and depends on patch 7

Changes in v15:
- Replace the direct attach and detach APIs with controller-only helpers
  that do not modify address-slot state, device lists or generic IBI
  lifecycle state
- Add controller-only helpers for device attach, reattach and detach,
  and for requesting, freeing, enabling, disabling and recycling IBI
  resources
- Rework the generic hub architecture to keep downstream logical device
  descriptors associated with their virtual controllers
- Add a permanent parent-facing descriptor for each downstream device
  and use it for operations handled by the physical parent controller
- Remove temporary descriptor reparenting and temporary hub dynamic
  address replacement from downstream transfer paths
- Forward downstream private transfers and the complete IBI lifecycle,
  including IBI slot recycling, through the parent-facing descriptor
  with appropriate parent-bus locking
- Add binding and MFD support for the P3H2440, P3H2441, P3H2840 and
  P3H2841 variants
- Fix the target-port reg schema and update the binding examples to use
  SMBus target-port nodes
- Read the device capability register to determine whether the device
  provides four or eight target ports
- Configure and register only the target ports implemented by the
  selected device variant
- Preserve the MFD parent's driver data and store the hub context in the
  shared MFD structure for use by IBI callbacks
- Validate target-port types and indices while ignoring non-target-port
  children, such as the regulators node, during Device Tree parsing
- Correct the SMBus transfer timeout calculation for 400 kHz operation
- Use I2C adapter quirks to enforce the maximum supported read and write
  payload lengths
- Publish callback-visible SMBus adapter state before adapter
  registration and roll it back if registration fails
- Rework SMBus slave registration and unregistration to use the shared
  protected-register lock and update software state only after the
  corresponding hardware operation succeeds
- Update the MFD source description to identify the device as an NXP
  P3H2x4x multi-port I3C hub instead of referring to it as an "MFD
  device driver"
- Link to v14: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-i3c/20260714092053.2461482-1-lakshay.piplani@nxp.com/T/#u

Changes in v14:
- Add i3c_master_register_fwnode() for virtual I3C masters and use it instead of temporarily changing
  parent dev->of_node
- Add runtime PM handling in i3c_master_send_ccc_cmd()
- Export i3c_bus_maintenance_lock()/unlock() and use them in hub paths
- Fix IBI request/free cleanup to handle forwarded callbacks that clear dev->ibi, and destroy the
  allocated IBI workqueue on request failure
- Add a shared MFD protected_reg_lock and use it for protected register accesses across P3H2X4X
  child drivers
- Rework regulator protected-register handling to restore the original protection state after
  each operation
- Serialize hub route selection around DAA, CCC, private transfer and IBI paths
- Hold the parent maintenance lock across temporary hub address reattach, transfer and address
  restore
- Fix SMBus polling interval calculation
- Clean up already registered SMBus adapters on adapter allocation or registration failure
- Fix SMBus slave receive status handling by clearing receive flags on error paths, using FIELD_GET()
  and explicitly clearing overflow status
- Link to v13: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-i3c/20260701065755.2067793-1-lakshay.piplani@nxp.com/T/#u

Changes in v13:
- Fix I3C master address management in direct attach/detach paths by using i3c_master_get_i3c_addrs()
  adding rollback on failure, skipping master self attach/detach, and properly releasing addresses to
  avoid stale state and use-after-free issues.
- Export and document address slot helper APIs for I3C hub support.
- Reserve parent bus address slots for downstream devices with identical static and assigned addresses
  by parsing target-port DT nodes prior to virtual controller registration, preventing DAA conflicts.
- Keep broadcast RSTDAA blocked with added documentation, and clarify intentional no-op callbacks
  and pending TODOs (e.g., IBI slot recycle).
- Rework SMBus transaction handling to use polling instead of fixed delays
  avoiding premature reads and data corruption.
- Fix DT handling issues by preventing duplicate target-port node leaks and restoring dev->of_node
  after temporary modification.
- Improve resource management using devm-based cleanup for DT nodes, IBI setup, adapter unregister
  and register relock paths.
- Make IBI setup optional and robust to avoid probe failures on unsupported platforms, with proper cleanup.
- Fix SMBus slave receive path by improving buffer handling, event delivery, and handling of unregistered ports.
- Strengthen concurrency handling with proper locking around shared state.
- Link to v12: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-i3c/20260617110355.1591844-1-lakshay.piplani@nxp.com/T/#u

Changes in v12:
- Rebased on i3c/next
- Dropped patches 1/9 and 2/9 from v11 as they are already applied
- Add address check in i3c_master_direct_detach_i3c_dev_locked() to skip
  detach for unaddressed devices
- Drop redundant depends on I3C from config I3C_HUB
- Return -EOPNOTSUPP for unsupported I2C transfers in the generic hub ops
- Correct default pull-up and drive-strength values
- Add devm cleanup for the IBI request/enable path
- Remove dead code and simplify cleanup by relying on devm-managed resources
- Fix SMBus slave client NULL handling and unregister cleanup
- Link to v11: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-i3c/20260612111816.3688240-1-lakshay.piplani@nxp.com/T/#u

Changes in v11:
- Convert i3c_master_supports_ccc_cmd() to return bool and align
  semantics with CCC support checks used by the I3C core
- Use MFD_CELL_NAME() for child device registration
- Rename driver names to follow subsystem conventions:
     - Use '-' instead of '_' in driver names
     - Drop the "_drv" suffix from driver names
- Fix virtual hub address reattach handling and parent bus locking
- Fix IBI request and cleanup error paths
- Improve SMBus slave mode payload validation and parsing

Changes in v10:
- Rename i3c_master_reattach_i3c_dev() to *_locked to reflect required
  bus locking
- Rename i3c_master_direct_attach_i3c_dev() and i3c_master_direct_detach_i3c_dev()
  to *_locked, as these APIs must be called with the bus lock held for write
- Drop redundant is_p3h2x4x_in_i3c flag from p3h2840.h
- Remove unnecessary ibi_lock handling in request/enable/disable/free
  IBI APIs

  master from hub_dev
